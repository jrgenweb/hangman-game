## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Learn how to play Hangman from the main menu.
- Start a game and choose a category.
- Play Hangman with a random word selected from that category.
- See their current health decrease based on incorrect letter guesses.
- Win the game if they complete the whole word.
- Lose the game if they make eight wrong guesses.
- Pause the game and choose to continue, pick a new category, or quit.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Navigate the entire game only using their keyboard.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
